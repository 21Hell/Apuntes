Google Cloud APIs are a key part of Google Cloud. Like services, the 200+ APIs, in areas that range from business administration to machine learning, all easily integrate with Google Cloud projects and applications.

APIs are _application programming interfaces_ that you can call directly or via the client libraries. Cloud APIs use resource-oriented design principles as described in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/).

When a lab provides a new Google Cloud project for a lab instance, it **enables many APIs automatically** so you can quickly start work on the lab's tasks. When you create your own Google Cloud **projects outside of the lab environment, you will have to enable APIs yourself**.

Most Cloud APIs provide you with detailed information on your project’s usage of that API, including traffic levels, error rates, and even latencies, which helps you quickly triage problems with applications that use Google services.

1. In the API search bar, type **Dialogflow**, and then click **Dialogflow API**. The Dialogflow description page opens.
    
    The Dialogflow API allows you to build rich conversational applications (e.g., for Google Assistant) without having to understand the underlying machine learning and natural language schema.
