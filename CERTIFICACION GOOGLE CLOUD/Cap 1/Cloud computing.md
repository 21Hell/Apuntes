is a way of using information technology (IT) that has these five equally important traits.



First, customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service.

Second, customers get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere they have a connection.

Third, the provider of those resources has a large pool of them, and allocates them to users out of that pool.

Fourth, the resources are elasticâ€“which means they can increase or decrease as needed, so customers can be flexible.

And finally, the customers pay only for what they use, or reserve as they go.
