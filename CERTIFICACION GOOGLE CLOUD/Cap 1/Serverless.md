Serverless computing allows developers to concentrate on their code, rather than on server configuration, by eliminating the need for any infrastructure management.

Serverless technologies offered by Google include Cloud Functions, which manages event-driven code as a pay-as-you-go service,

 Cloud Run, which allows customers to deploy their containerized microservicesâ€“based application in a fully managed environment.
