[[IaaS]]
With Compute Engine, users can create and run virtual machines in Google's innovative data centers and on its global fiber network.



There are no upfront investments, and thousands of virtual CPUs can run on a system that is designed to be fast and offer consistent performance. Each virtual machine contains the power and functionality of a full-fledged operating system. This means a virtual machine can be configured much like a physical server: by specifying the amount
of CPU power and memory needed, the amount and type of storage needed, and the operating system.


The instance can run Linux and Windows Server images provided by Google or any customized versions of these images.
