Cloud Functions is a lightweight, event-based, asynchronous compute solution that allows you to create small, single-purpose


functions that respond to cloud events without needing to manage a server or a runtime environment.

You can use these functions to construct applications from bite-sized business logic.

You are billed to the nearest 100 milliseconds, but only while your code is running.

Individual Cloud Functions are written in Javascript (Node.js), Python, or Go and executed in a managed Node.js environment on Google Cloud.

Events from Cloud Storage and Pub/Sub can trigger Cloud Functions asynchronously, or you can use HTTP invocation for synchronous execution.
