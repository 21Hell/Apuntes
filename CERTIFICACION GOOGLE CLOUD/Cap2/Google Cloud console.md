This hierarchy is made up of four levels, and starting from the bottom up they are: resources, projects, folders, and an organization node.

![[Pasted image 20231010233527.png]]Resources are organized into projects, which sit on the second level.

Projects can be organized into folders, or even subfolders.

And then at the top level is an organization node, which encompasses all the projects, folders, and resources in your organization.

[[Projects]] are the basis for enabling and using Google Cloud services, like managing APIs, enabling billing, adding and removing collaborators, and enabling other Google services.

The third level of the Google Cloud resource hierarchy is [[folders]].
You can use folders to group projects under an [[organization]] in a hierarchy.
To use folders, you must have an organization node, which is the topmost resource in the Google Cloud hierarchy.
Everything else attached to that account goes under this node, which includes projects, folders, and other resources.
