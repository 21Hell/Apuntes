A [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview/#projects) is an organizing entity for your Google Cloud resources. It often contains resources and services; for example, it may hold a pool of virtual machines, a set of databases, and a network that connects them together. Projects also contain settings and permissions, which specify security rules and who has access to what resources

The upper-left corner of the central pane contains a card labeled _Project info_ that looks like this:

Your project has a _name_, _number_, and _ID_. These identifiers are frequently used when interacting with Google Cloud services. You are working with one project to get experience with a specific service or feature of Google Cloud.

It's not uncommon for large enterprises or experienced users of Google Cloud to have dozens to thousands of Google Cloud projects. Organizations use Google Cloud in different ways, so projects are a good method for organizing cloud computing services (by team or product, for example.)
### Navigation menu and services

The Google Cloud console title bar also contains the **Navigation menu** icon, which appears as three lines:

![Navigation menu icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/jNaEVX1xXeOOasukmY%2B9mcktmn9gjkwgNAJEkBlIYbI%3D "Navigation menu icon")

Clicking this icon opens (or hides) the _Navigation menu_ that provides quick access to Google Cloud's core services.

1. If the menu isn't open, click **Navigation menu**.
2. Click **More Products**, then scroll through the categories of tools and services.

[This link](https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview/cloud-platform-services#top_of_page) takes you to documentation that covers each of these categories in more detail.
